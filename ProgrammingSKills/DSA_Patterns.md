# DSA Patterns for problem solving
### IDentify the pattens and most of the DSA problems fit into one of the avaialble patterns.

Lets see what are these high level patterns that we can fit the problems into
## Two pointer techniques
- Ideally we would have problem statements around Array or LinkedList in this pattern.
We iterate over a single array/list using two pointer to solve the problem statement.
- Technique to solve |- Create the an additional pointer to traverse, either forward | backward depending on the problem.
- Create the logic around it.
